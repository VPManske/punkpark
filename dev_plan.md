## CryptoCitizens
Need to make a smartcontract that gives out 'citizen' token for only about $1
The citizens can be traded / bought / sold
The citizens can be assigned a 'look' 16x16
There can be infinite citizens but they burn eth

There is a function called 'get citizen price' and the price depends on the number of citizens created and the number of blocks mined since contract creation.  The more citizens there are the higher the price is, the more blocks there are the lower the price is . The price will always be very low.
